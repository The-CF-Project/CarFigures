Admin Panel Maintainers (will be referred to as APMs) add cars to the bot. You may request a car to be added in Suggestions or talk to an APM. However, its not that easy.You first must provide what itâ€™s rarity is (what are the chances of you catching it), Its weight in Kilograms, full name, a catch card picture of the vehicle, the info picture of the car for the card, Its horsepower, ability (what it does to other vehicles) and ability desc. At the bottom of each card notice it says image credits and car suggester, you must provide the names of who suggested and found what, however if its all you, then you can type yourself. This can be anything you think of just nothing too crazy. Once approved, It can be added by one of the APMs. After this one of the people will reload the cache so it can then spawn. These regular cars are free.
