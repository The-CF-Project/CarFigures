CF Comes with easy-to-use server configuration to allow server owners to have more control over how CF behave in their server, but of course, we first need to work a bit, let’s set this up shall we? First we need to use /server channel to select the desired channel for spawning, you will get to read the summary of the terms of services alongside the links to TOS and PP, after that, you can now select a role to ping (just note that even when giving the “Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles, CF won’t ping both everyone and here), as it has a built in mechanism to prevent such act, so select a role that can be pinged by CF, after that, you are done, and in any time you can check your server’s profile by doing /server profile.
