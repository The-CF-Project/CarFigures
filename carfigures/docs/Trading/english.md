Trading your car in Car Figures is one of the most important things.
Here is where you can obtain some of the rarest and coolest Car Figures from anyone. (Of course, if they want to trade).

There is a /trade begin command. Use this to start a trade. It will ask for you to Ping them. Once done, the trade will start. You and the other person can use /trade add to add one of your Car Figures in your inventory to the trade, or use /trade remove to remove a Car Figure from trade. If you end up not wanting to trade, use /trade cancel to cancel the trade. If you do trade and you both agree, go to where Car Figures sent the trade and click accept. You now want to click lock, so that itâ€™s confirmed you want to trade and you may not cancel the trade at this time. Now, you just wait for the other to accept and lock in there trade. Once both parties have done this, you will both automatically receive the vehicles you traded into your inventory. You may use /trade history to review your past trades. After 30 minutes of inactivity while trading, the trade will automatically cancel
