- **Chaotic PRs are less likely to be accepted** Its better to keep the PR concise and focused.
- **Stale PRs are less likely to be accepted** if they have been open for a long time and have not been merged, or if they have not been reviewed by the maintainers, reviewers, or community members, for reasons including no activity or no feedback.
